**BIO**

I have been to a bullfight in Portugal. I was in Italy in 2006 when they beat France in the World Cup Final. I  helped move furniture for Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the internet in his home in Concorda, MA. I have O-negative blood, universal donor. I memorized all the flags of Europe and still remember most. I claimed citizenship from two countires, New Zealand and America. I have watched the New Zealand All Blacks win a game (they win about 80% of all games). I used to create trivia questions for fun. I use leather and various tools to stitch wallets together. I collect bookmarks and bottlecaps.

Reasons I like Rugby and provided a youtube link
+ The 2019 Rugby World Cup is happening right now in Japan
+ The play is fairly continuous
+ There are no pads
+ There is international competition, from Europe to South America, Africa, and Oceania/Asia
+ America is starting to improve their skills
+ My family is from New Zealand and it was passed to my by my Father who is a big fan

and I believe the last reason is probably the most important. Family history has a large influence on people's lives.
